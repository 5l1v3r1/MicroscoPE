# ðŸ”¬ MicroscoPE
[![Build Status](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/backslash/MicroscoPE)
  
  As part of wanting to improve my understanding of the portable executable I created MicroscoPE, a minimalistic tool designed to give you easy and quick information about any portable executable. While tools like CFF explorer exist to give a user interface for this stuff. I figured it might be nice to have a command line version, just so one can get quick information.
